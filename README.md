# Cadmus CHGC App V2

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5. This V2 repository is derived from the original, production [V1 CHGC app repository](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-chgc-app) by replacing Annotorious V2 with V3 using [ngx-annotorious](https://github.com/vedph/ngx-annotorious). As such this is the first experimental Cadmus solution based on this new brick.
